@article{taka2011humanbetawave,
abstract = {Previous studies in non-human primates have shown that beta oscillations (15-30Hz) of local field potentials (LFPs) in the arm/hand areas of primary motor cortex (MI) propagate as traveling waves across the cortex. These waves exhibited two stereotypical features across animals and tasks: 1) The waves propagated in two dominant modal directions roughly 180 degrees apart, and 2) their propagation speed ranged from 10 \~{} 35 cm/s. It is, however, unknown if such cortical waves occur in the human motor cortex. This study shows that the two properties of propagating beta waves are present in MI of a tetraplegic human patient while he was instructed to perform an instruction delay center out task using a cursor controlled by the chin. Moreover, we show that beta waves are sustained and have similar properties whether the subject was engaged in the task or at rest. The directions of the successive sustained waves both in the human subject and a nonhuman primate (NHP) subject tended to switch from one dominant mode to the other, and at least in the NHP subject the estimated distance travelled between successive waves traveling into and out of the central sulcus is consistent with the hypothesis of wave reflection between the border of motor and somatosensory cortices. Further, we show that the occurrence of the beta waves is not uniquely tied to periods of increased power in the beta frequency band. These results demonstrate that traveling beta waves in MI are a general phenomenon occurring in human as well as non-human primates. Consistent with the non-human primate data, the dominant directions of the beta LFP waves in human aligned to the proximal to distal gradient of joint representations in MI somatotopy. This consistent finding of wave propagation may imply the existence of a hardwired organization of motor cortex that mediates this spatio-temporal pattern.},

@article{doug2006betawave,
abstract = {High-frequency oscillations in the beta range (10-45 Hz) are most active in motor cortex during motor preparation and are postulated to reflect the steady postural state or global attentive state of the animal. By simultaneously recording multiple local field potential signals across the primary motor and dorsal premotor cortices of monkeys (Macaca mulatta) trained to perform an instructed-delay reaching task, we found that these oscillations propagated as waves across the surface of the motor cortex along dominant spatial axes characteristic of the local circuitry of the motor cortex. Moreover, we found that information about the visual target to be reached was encoded in terms of both latency and amplitude of evoked waves at a time when the field phase-locked with respect to the target onset. These findings suggest that high-frequency oscillations may subserve intra- and inter-cortical information transfer during movement preparation and execution.},

The event-related desynchronization (ERD) of alpha band and beta rhythms can be seen as a correlate of an activated cortical area with an increased excitability level of neurons. An event-related synchronization (ERS) of frequency components between 10 and 13 Hz may represent a deactivated cortical area or inhibited cortical network, at least under certain circumstances. It is hypothesized, that antagonistic ERD/ERS patterns, called ‚Äòfocal ERD/surround ERS‚Äô, may reflect a thalamo-cortical mechanism to enhance focal cortical activation by simultaneous inhibition of other cortical areas. Induced oscillations in the beta band (13‚Äì35 Hz, beta ERS) were found in sensorimotor areas after voluntary movement and after somatosensory stimulation. This may be interpreted as a state of ‚Äòinhibition‚Äô of neural circuitry in the primary motor cortex. Simultaneous activation of the motor cortex by e.g. motor imagery lead to an attenuation of the beta ERS. Moreover, there is evidence that the frequency of the induced beta oscillations represent a ‚Äòresonance-like frequency‚Äô of underlying cortical networks. However, further research is needed to investigate the functional meaning of bursts of beta oscillations below 35 Hz. "

abstract = "Voluntary movements are accompanied by amplitude changes in cortical rhythms presumably as a result of functional activation of sensorimotor areas. Recently, the location of the neural generators involved in increasing power within the beta (15‚Äì30¬†Hz) frequency band following movement (post-movement beta rebound, PMBR) has come into question [Parkes, L.M, Bastiaansen, M.C.M, Norris, D.G., 2006. Combining \{EEG\} and fMRI to investigate the post-movement beta rebound. NeuroImage 29, 685‚Äì696.]. We used the synthetic aperture magnetometry (SAM) spatial filtering method to identify the time course and location of oscillatory changes within the beta and mu (8‚Äì14¬†Hz) frequency bands during the performance of voluntary movements. Neuromagnetic activity was recorded from 10 adult subjects during abduction of the right index finger. Changes in beta and mu source power were calculated for periods during and following movement, relative to pre-movement baseline activity. Decreases in beta band activity (event-related desynchronization, ERD) were observed during movement, with a strong increase (PMBR) beginning 230&#xa0;¬±&#xa0;170¬†ms following movement, lasting for 680&#xa0;¬±&#xa0;170¬†ms. Mu band \{ERD\} was observed both during and following movement, with little to no post-movement rebound. Beta and mu \{ERD\} were localized bilaterally to the hand region of postcentral gyrus whereas \{PMBR\} was localized bilaterally to the hand region of precentral gyrus (motor cortex). Both \{PMBR\} and beta \{ERD\} were strongest contralateral to the side of movement. These results provide further evidence that movement influences independent cortical rhythms in sensorimotor areas, and confirm previous reports of precentral generators of \{PMBR\} in the region of motor cortex, with postcentral generators of beta and mu \{ERD\} during movement.
